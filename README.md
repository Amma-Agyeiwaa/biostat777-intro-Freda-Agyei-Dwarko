## Project Overview
This repository hosts a personal Quarto website created for **Biostat 777 – Introduction to Data Science in Public Health**.  
The website includes:

1. **Home Page** – A brief introduction and photo  
2. **About Page** – Biography, education, and professional experience  
3. **Example Analysis Page** – A reproducible data analysis using the **Gapminder** dataset to explore the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita.

The project demonstrates the use of:
- Quarto for reproducible scientific publishing  
- R programming and the *tidyverse* for data wrangling and visualization  
- Git + GitHub + GitHub Pages for version control and web deployment
