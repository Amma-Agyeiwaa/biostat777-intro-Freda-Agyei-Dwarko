    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nAcross regions from 1962 onward, life expectancy tends to rise with income, and the relationship is clearer on a log scale of GDP per capita. Faceted scatterplots show that the positive association holds within continents, though variation remains across countries at similar income levels. Ghana’s trend line illustrates gradual improvements in life expectancy over time relative to the world median, with periods of slower gains. These descriptive views support hypotheses about economic development and longevity but do not establish causality; formal modeling would need to account for confounding and time-varying factors. Still, the tidy workflow and layered plots provide a reproducible baseline for deeper analyses."
